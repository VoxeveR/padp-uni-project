# PaDP_Uni_Project
Parallel and distributed processing university classes.

## MPI_Matrix_Inversion
This folder contains the implementation of matrix inversion using MPI (Message Passing Interface). The task focuses on parallelizing the matrix inversion process by distributing the workload across multiple processes, improving performance for large matrices.

## Mpi-Matrix_Multipl
The MPI Matrix Multiplying folder features an optimized version of matrix multiplication using MPI. The project emphasizes efficient parallelization, ensuring proper load balancing and reduced computational time for large matrix operations.

## RMI_Gauss/Gauss
This folder contains the Gauss elimination method implementation using Java RMI. It parallelizes the Gaussian elimination process to solve systems of linear equations, improving performance by executing independent parts of the algorithm concurrently.

## SunRPC_Chebyshev/czebyszew-threads
This folder showcases the implementation of Chebyshev polynomials using SunRPC for remote procedure calls and parallel threads for computation.
